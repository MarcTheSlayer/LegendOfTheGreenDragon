-  Hi, Iâ€™m @MarcTheSlayer

-  I used to play Legend of the Green Dragon 2005 (LoGD/LotGD), which is a browser (PHP/MySQL) text based RPG created by Eric Stevens & JT Traub,
-  which is based off of a BBS Door game, Legend of the Red Dragon 1989 (LoRD) created by Seth Able Robinson.

-  Modules could be written for it and easily installed. And over the years hundreds of modules were written to help customise/improve the basic game.
-  The last official version was v1.1.2 back in 2013. You need to know how to code to fix all the issues that crop up yourself.

-  **I've created this repository to host the modules that I created and/or modified. Simply because.**

-  LoGD (after version 0.9.7) and all modules are released under a Creative Commons License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/
